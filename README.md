## Hello!üëã
Thank you for visiting my profile. My name is Stephen and I am based out of Denver, CO. üèîÔ∏è

I am a tech-driven professional currently working on multiple projects in the fields of eCommerce, Customer Service, and Communications. I have been with my company for five years, gaining managerial-type experience for the last two years by managing a small team. Fun fact, our company was ranked thirty-ninth by Forbes in their 2025 list of America's Best Companies!üèÜ

I'm looking to collaborate on interesting projects that help me learn more about topics that I could see being beneficial to know as we move toward a more tech-driven society each and every year.

I'm looking for help with the files listed within my repositories, especially with my past projects from school. I understand a lot of my files may be inefficient, unorganized, or bug infested. Cleaning up those projects and obtaining a better understanding on what may have been incorrect, or on what was holding them back from the endgoal would be very helpful!

Ask me about some of the best practices I use while collaborating on eCommerce projects. I will provide as much information as I am able to discuss. Otherwise, ask me about sports, specifically football as I grew up playing for 14 years! I also enjoy heading up to the slopes during the Winter months. My favorite mountain is Crested Butte, but I am more of a regular at Copper Mountain and Winter Park.

Thank you for reading and I look forward to potentially collaborating in the near future!
